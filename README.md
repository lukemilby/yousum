The tutorial is about making effective YouTube tutorials. The three rules are having a clear 
and concise title and thumbnail, keeping the first three to five seconds useful and not wasteful, 
and making the rest of the video engaging. The presenter recommends using free, legal art assets 
and putting them in an easily accessible place, as well as practicing the tutorial multiple times 
before recording to minimize editing. For programming tutorials, it's suggested to have the code 
pre-written and copy and paste it into the tutorial instead of writing it out loud. Finally, the 
presenter suggests making a course and selling it on sites like Udemy or Gumroad to earn more money.
